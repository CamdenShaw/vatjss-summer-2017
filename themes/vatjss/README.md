# Vancouver Aboriginal Transformative Justice Services Society (VATJSS)

A fully functional webpage designed for a non-profit agency that provide opportunity for positive transformative justice to the Aboriginal people within the Metro-Vancouver area.

## Getting Started

Make sure to turn on your MAMP!

### Installing

#### 1. Download me (don't clone me!)

Then add me to your `wp-content` directory.

#### 2. Rename the `redstarter` directory

Make sure that the theme directory name is project appropriate!

#### 3. Install the dev dependencies

Next you'll need to run `npm install` **inside your theme directory** next to install the node modules you'll need for Gulp, etc.

#### 4. Update the proxy in `gulpfile.js`

Lastly, be sure to update your `gulpfile.js` with the appropriate URL for the Browsersync proxy (so change `vatjss.dev` to the appropriate localhost URL).
